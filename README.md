# Eye-Exercise
This is a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. When you move the mouse, the mouse events are being picked up and we're moving the eyeball to match the mouse. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page.

## Description of Project:
This is a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. When you move the mouse, the mouse events are being picked up and we're moving the eyeball to match the mouse. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page.

## How to Run:
Very simple. Move your mouse. Two eyes will follow your mouse movement.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
We plan to add some delays to eye movements to make them more real. Eventually, we are planning to develop a set of two eyes that follow your eye movements via camera!
